# Munchies Food App

## Project Info
Munchies is an Android app where users can input and rate dishes from a restuarant under a specific food type. Users are then able to go through the app and view their added entries as well as see the location of the restaurant on a map.

## How We Built It
We used Kotlin, Google Maps, and Google Ads in Android Studio.

## Future Plans
We would like to set up a backend to allow for crowdsourcing.
